# Game_Programming
A repository for assignments and programs in the Game Programming class I am taking at Augsburg
This is my first time using html and javascript but so far the projects have been exciting and I tend to go a lot
farther with the games then required for the class. 

From these projects I have learned the basics of HTML and Javascript including how to set up a simple webpage, how to handle input and output, rendering a game map of some kind, and interacting with different images. 

# Prime Number Game
This game is a simple guessing game where the user needs to guess a prime number between 
1 and 25 in only 3 guesses. The game is set up to auto generate a new number using the rand() function, as
well as using switch to properly respond to the user's input. 

# Pirates and Navy
Another simple game, although this one is not complete. The end goal will be to have the user navigate across the sea to
reach the home on the other side while avoiding the other pirate ships and a water monster. In addition to that they 
will also need to maintain a store of food to travel and can get a high score through obtaining gold and experience
from fighting pirates. I put my own twist on this and changed the ships to represent colleges in my area.
